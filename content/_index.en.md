Biograbber is a free professional video capture software for standards sources of V4L2 (Video for Linux) and UVC (USB Video Class).

There are many free software projects supporting the development of applications capable of capturing video following the standard V4L2. However, the functional development of these projects is very limited and does not meet professional requirements.

Any video device compatible with UVC standard will work with Biograbber, including webcams, but also many other professional capture devices capable of transforming signals HDMI, SDI, VGA, DVI, VHS, S-VHS, etc. to a USB signal compatible with UVC.
